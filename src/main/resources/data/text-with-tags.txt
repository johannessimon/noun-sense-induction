<span>Feature Wish List</span>
<p>The following features are still not supported properly by ATI's driver:</p>
<li>Composite Extension: The ATI driver is far behind other open source Xorg drivers in supporting Composite extension. Clearly they are not keeping up and will benefit significantly by releasing their source code under GPL or BSD or MIT license.</li>
<li>Removing the need to enable module support in the kernel to fully install the driver. It will work without it, but that doesn't enable DRI. This is possible by releasing their source code under the GPL license, and creating a patch for the kernel.</li>
