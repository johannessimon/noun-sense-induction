"That's what you should use in your house. Blues and greens - no reds. No fire colours."</p>   <p>I'm enroute to Lower Johnson Street, but can't resist sitting on a fold-away chair in front of his table for a feng shui tarot and element readings. After some number wizardry with my name and birthdate, and a pronouncement that I'm a metal-wood combination, he offers me the décor tips.</p>   <p>The odd thing is, he's right. The only time I tried red in my living room, the ruby leather chair that had looked gorgeous in the furniture store refused point blank to fit in. So, I'm back to blues and greens - which is perhaps why Victoria appeals so much: the emerald stretches of the parks, an ocean that runs from sulky blue under a leaden sky to turquoise under sunlight - even the limes and emeralds of the nearby forested mountains.</p>   <p>These hues merge beautifully around the harbour downtown, where even the green copper domes of the Legislative Buildings add to the palette.</p>   <p>But as every good designer knows, pops of colour in an otherwise serene view can add energy and interest.</p>   <p>And that's where LoJo comes in.</p>   <p>Brightly painted Victorian-era shop-fronts flank both sides of busy Lower Johnson Street between Wharf and Government Streets. Once home to hotels and stores supporting the gold rushes of the 1850s and 1890s, today the area is known for its local and independent boutiques and restaurants.</p>   <p>It would be easy to while away a couple of hours here, but we've gone a step further and put together a full day's walking tour of sampling, sightseeing and, yes, shopping.</p>   <p>It's based on LoJo, but takes you easily from the harbour six blocks away to Lower Johnson and slightly beyond.</p>   <p>So, put on your comfy walking shoes, as we show you the highlights.</p>   <p>Step 1.</p>   <p>There are plenty of hotels and other accommodations around the harbour, so it's an ideal start point - spend a few minutes leaning on the stone wall surrounding it to watch the water taxis, sea buses and float planes buzzing in and out.</p>   <p>Then head four blocks north to 1110 Government Street to Murchie's Tea and Coffee, for breakfast.</p>   <p>More than a century old, the company roasts its own coffee beans and blends its own teas in Richmond (on the mainland); here, the restaurant offers break-fasts, lunches and afternoon teas, ranging from pastries and pre-serves to heartier fare, plus retail space.</p>   <p>Step 2.</p>   <p>A few steps north of Murchie's, look left for the entrance to Bastion Square, named after the log towers, or bastions, that were once part of the fort built here in 1843.</p>   <p>It now serves as an artisan's market, with everything from art cards and prints made from lo-cal seaweeds to jewelry and, of course, the opportunity for a few minutes of entertainment (and décor tips).</p>   <p>The market (look for the brightly coloured "tulip" sculpture) runs Thursdays through Saturdays, with a farmers' market on Sundays, until Sept. 30.</p>   <p>If you're into maritime history, Bastion Square also offers the Maritime Museum of BC; if you'd rather spa, the Sapphire Day Spa is about two blocks east on View Street, where owner Heidi Sherwood offers a warm welcome that focuses on community and authenticity.</p>   <p>Options include both esthetics and energy balancing work; many of the treatments feature Pacific seaweed and the locally produced Seaflora skincare line.</p>   <p>Step 3.</p>   <p>From Bastion Square, you can walk along Commercial Alley to Yates Street, shop and cross Yates into Waddington alley (look down at the wooden cobblestones laid in the early 1900s) - to be deposited onto the south side of John-son Street. A wander along the candy-coloured shopfronts here showcases a number of locally owned shops and boutiques.</p>   <p>A few to watch for? The tiny space of Smoking Lily, a label that belongs to several local women who create clothing, accessories and home items, along with the most amazing vertical merchandizing.</p>   <p>The small Paperbox Arcade, with several boutiques - including Salts, offering stylish, soft, eco-friendly and natural fabrics clothing made in Victoria.</p>   <p>Back on the street is Saltspring Soapworks, with products brought in from the nearby island (try the rainbow-hued body gelatos - a great sea salt scrub to soften hands and feet).</p>   <p>If you've worked up an appetite for lunch, try Willie's Bakery, at 537 Johnson Street.</p>   <p>It's the city's oldest bakery, offering hearty sandwiches and baked goods, along with excellent coffee, in a 19th-century red brick building with a lovely courtyard</p>   <p>Step 4.</p>   <p>Cross to the north side of Johnson, where Market Square offers more boutique shopping, with more than 30 stores and restaurants.</p>   <p>You can easily spend an hour or two here; if you're not shopped or walked out, head two blocks north of Johnson, to 1624 Government Street, where sits the bright red storefront of Silk Road, a Victoria institution - part tea shop, part beauty shop and spa.</p>   <p>Staff greet you with freshly brewed tea samples, and are always happy to share tips and testers.</p>   <p>Almost next door is the en-trance to Victoria's Chinatown, with the ornate Gates of Harmonious Interest spanning Fisgard Street, which leads you, left, to Fan Tan Alley (Victoria's narrowest alley) back toward Market Square.</p>   <p>Step 5.</p>   <p>Return south toward the harbour along Wharf Street. Since all that walking works up an appetite, try the blue-grey sea container-Cturned-restaurant Red Fish Blue Fish, at 1006 Wharf Street, on Broughton Street Pier.</p>   <p>Piping hot, locally caught and Ocean Wise certified fish options include Pacific halibut, wild salmon and Qualicum scallops, taking fish and chips well beyond the usual.</p>   <p>There's only outdoor seating, so if it's a wet day, you may want to opt for stopping back on Johnson Street at Il Terazzo, one of Victoria's oldest Italian restaurants, reservations recommended).</p>   <p>If You Go</p>   <p>- Getting there: WestJet and Air Canada fly direct from Calgary to Victoria several times daily.</p>   <p>- Staying there: Part of LoJo's charm is its independent boutiques. If this appeals to you in a hotel as well, try the harbourside Inn at Laurel Point (laurelpoint. com), designed in part by Canadian architect Arthur Erickson and home to the locally renowned Aura restaurant.</p>   <p>- Getting around: Although downtown Victoria is eminently walkable, and there are plenty of cycling trails, renting a car from the airport will assist with nearby touring, including the Saanich Peninsula, the Cowichan Valley and along the west coast of Vancouver Island.</p>   <h2>Comments</h2>   <div>We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Click on the image to explore the scene&nbsp;with HDView (plug-in required).</a>   <p>In the wake of Haiti's earthquake , satellites are helping rescuers pinpoint where the need is greatest - and reconnecting the ruined nation with the outside world.</p>   <p>Emergency responders and military personnel - plus journalists, of course - are scrambling to get into Port-au-Prince, where hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been in need of assistance since Tuesday's magnitude-7&nbsp;shock. At the same time, satellite operators are scrambling to&nbsp;get a better look at the devastation, and provide the support for aid organizations on the ground.</p>   <p>The amount of data streams beaming up from Haiti to Inmarsat's telecom satellites has already skyrocketed, said Jack Deasy, director for civil government programs at Inmarsat Government Services . "While it's not as intense as Afghanistan, it is a number of times up from anything normal in that region," he told me today.</p>   <p>Mark Brender, vice president of communications for GeoEye , said satellite imagery serves as "virtual truth serum, and provides governments and relief organizations with an instant snapshot of the lay of the land."</p>   <p>"Our imagery over Haiti, for example, showed how many people went to sports stadiums and open areas," he told me. "Well, that's knowledge. Maybe that's where you ought to provide food and water first."</p>   <a>Wednesday's imagery from the GeoEye-1 satellite can be compared with "before" imagery, such&nbsp;as an&nbsp;Ikonos satellite view from 2008 ( 7MB version ), to determine which areas of the Haitian capital suffered the most damage. The post-quake picture shows a flattened presidential palace ... a ruined cathedral ... crumbled military barracks ... and tumbled-over cargo containers in Port-au-Prince's port. ( This New York Times interactive cleverly blends the before-and-after views.)</a>   <p>In the early stages of a relief operation, satellite maps can show rescuers the worst-hit places in a disaster zone, or the best place to set up headquarters. Radar imagery can be used to monitor the region even when it's covered with clouds, and even detect the surface deformations that may signal aftershocks or landslides to come.</p>   <strong>Reconnecting to the world When&nbsp;the rescuers arrive, one of the most immediate needs beyond food, water and medicine&nbsp;is the need to communicate.&nbsp;The quake dealt a heavy blow to Haiti's standard communication links .</strong>   <td>A Broadband Global Area Network terminal, or BGAN, is about the size of a laptop computer and connects with a satellite network to transmit voice or data.</td>   <p>"Without communication, it's incredibly hard to talk about what's needed in terms of shelter, food, medical supplies and so forth," said Bill Brindley, chief executive officer of NetHope , a consortium of 28 nongovernmental relief organizations.</p>   <p>Here again, satellites are coming to the rescue. Telecoms Sans Frontieres , a French-based international relief organization, was among the first on the scene with BGAN terminals . (The acronym, pronounced " bee -gan",&nbsp;stands for broadband global area network.)</p>   <p>The BGAN devices are about as big as a netbook or laptop computer, and cost from $1,000 to $4,000 each. They provide a mobile hookup for phone or data communication (wireless or wired) through the Inmarsat satellite network, at rates that are structured like cell-phone plans (but more expensive).</p>   <p>Telecoms Sans Frontieres is hooking up terminals to facilitate communications for U.N. relief workers in Haiti, and will eventually let Haitians make free two-minute phone calls to anywhere in the world. The group's U.S. representative, Paul Margie, said the biggest challenge isn't technology but security. "The security and logistics situation on the ground is pretty bad, so finding secure locations to do these things is hard," he told me.</p>   <p>Inmarsat's Deasy said the data traffic is rising rapidly as teams from around the world converge on Haiti, bringing tens or scores of the BGAN terminals with them.</p>   <p>"We expect that demand to go up as more teams arrive, and we expect to be able to accommodate that demand," he said. "Then it becomes a question of the details of how people go into the country."</p>   <p>The next stage involves putting down small satellite dishes (known as VSATs , or very small aperture terminals)&nbsp;to beef up the communications networks.</p>   <p>Governmental relief operations are already getting VSATs on the scene, and relying upon satellite services donated by satellite operators such as SES World Skies. "Satellite networks play a quintessential role in disaster recovery, when speed is of the essence," Rob Bednarek, the company's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement .</p>   <p>As the Haiti crisis unfolds, Telecoms Sans Frontieres plans to transition from the BGAN terminals to high-frequency and VHF communication links, supplemented by VSATs, Margie said.</p>   <p>Like many relief agencies, Telecoms Sans Frontieres has been on the scene for a series of disasters, ranging from Caribbean hurricanes to Asian earthquakes. "Every emergency is very different from the last," Margie said. "The challenge of yesterday's emergency is not the challenge of the next one."</p>   <strong>A net of connectivity Every crisis brings new innovations as well:&nbsp;For example, NetHope is putting together a novel&nbsp;combination of VSAT dishes and WiMax wireless networks to cover Port-au-Prince with a net of connectivity.</strong>   <p>"It will create a 10-megabit-per-second network that can be used for two purposes," NetHope's Brindley told me. "First, phone connectivity for setting up voice over Internet, so [relief workers] can begin to communicate. The second thing will be Internet connectivity. That will allow for GIS mapping, it will allow for FTP for photos, it will allow for video. ... It provides a full stack of communication technologies for allowing the teams to coordinate and for assessments to be done."</p>   <p>More than 20 of NetHope's members are involved in Haiti disaster relief - and coordinating all that activity can be a complicated and expensive proposition. NetHope says its VSAT/WiMax telecom system will cost $25,000 ,&nbsp;and it's currently raising the money to cover that expense.</p>   <p>Fortunately, millions of dollars are streaming in from mobile phone users around the world to help Haiti - and support is streaming in as well for the work being done by NetHope, Telecoms Sans Frontieres and other gearhead do-gooders. "We've really seen a tremendous response from the corporate world, primarily the high-tech companies that are partnering with us, as well as individuals," Brindley said.</p>   <p>When the crisis eases, Brindley expects that NetHope will hand the system over to the Haitians themselves. But at this point, no one can predict how long the crisis will last. At this point, keeping up the communication links amid Haiti's chaos is challenge enough.</p>   <p>"We'll be used in Haiti for a year, there's no question," Inmarsat's Deasy said. "But our unique value in this area is that first 24 to 48 hours."</p>   <strong>Update for 9:30 p.m.: NASA has put up several images from its Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000 that show Haiti's highs and lows, including the seismic fault that gave way during&nbsp;this week's quake.</strong>

Office gossip, dirty dishes, the wrong look - anything could set him off. And once it did, nothing stopped the most terrifying killer Oregon police had ever met...A need to kill: Only murder appeased Shaw's fury. But he didn't kill the people who offended him. They were the lucky ones. Instead, he hunted down innocent victims - men, women, teenage beauties - and unleashed his bloody urge to kill...to rape...to paint in blood. A murderer's boast: Finally, with the courageous testimony of a survivor, and high-tech CSI, Shaw was put behind bars for life. But the gruesome tale didn't end there, as Shaw bragged about a dozen more murders he had never been charged with...</div>

If you are considering it....BUT IT!!. The bag actually is large and fits everything and anything. It has such a sophistication about it. I get compliments wherever I go!!!! The leather is soft and just so you know the bag is slouchy so dont eexpect it to be stiff and hold shape. I fit my Ipad, sunglasses, make-up bag, wallet, keys, phone, and 2 magazines in this bag and had more room!!! Its just gorgeous!!!</div>   <div>I ended up getting this bag at department store after seeing it on Shopbop! It is amazing, if you are thinking about it, order it. The leather is amazing and the colors go with everything. The first day I used it I got compliments all day.</div>

The Nats have no trouble putting guys on base. They have all kinds of trouble actually scoring them.</p>   <p>In the afternoon's first five innings, they came to bat 13 times with a man on base. They did not record a hit in any of those at-bats.</p>   <div>SEE RELATED:</div>   <p>The streak finally snapped in the sixth, when Wil Nieves and Nick Johnson each singled to load the bases. But then Cristian Guzman grounded into a forceout at third, pushing a run across but recording another out. And then Alberto Gonzalez flied out to end the inning.</p>   <p>So the Nats are 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position today. Since June 4, they are 7-for-46 in such situations. That's not good.</p>

But after so many installments, it's collected into a graphic novel, and there are two out so far. The Freakangels are a group of people with unusual and mysterious powers that are protecting a section of a city and it's population in a post-apocalyptic world. Oh, and unbeknownst to those they protect, they are accidentally responsible for the apocalypse. The Freakangels are reminiscent of the Endless from Neil Gaiman's acclaimed Sandman series, but much more human. Some are crazy, some are depraved, and at least one is just plain bad. Paul Duffield's art is subtle but charming - a European style that at first seems plain but then reveals itself to be gorgeous. (Posted on 2/5/12)</dd>

The total gross for the 10-show slate was $11,431,844. Most of the shows actually saw an increase in grosses, with "Jersey Boys" being the sole exception. Additionally, three more records fell, one at the metropolitan level, and two at individual theaters. "The Lion King" broke the mark for highest single week theatrical gross in the history of Vancouver, B.C., netting $1,812,814. "Mamma Mia!" had held the record since 2005. Meanwhile, "Wicked" broke two more of its own house records, one at Houston's Hobby Center, where it raked in $1,527,077, and another at Milwaukee's Marcus Center, where it tallied $1,413,203.</p>

The population at the census of 1897 was 8,972, including 3,924 Jews. Of the latter a few are engaged in agriculture, the pursuit of which was nearly closed to them by the laws of 1882. Three hundred and eighty-nine Jews are engaged in manufacturing peasants' shoes, which are sold at the markets of the Kherson and Bessarabian governments. The economic condition of these Jews is getting worse every year, as may be seen by the increasing number of families asking for charity at Passover (120 families in 1898).

Just curious, since I'm not in academia, but is this a typical   compensation ($18,000/yr). Is this for a full time job? Or is the   person going to be out getting some other funds, and the subject   research is just part of their overall work. Or do they get some   other stipend/living allowance. (Here in California, this would be   just about minimum wage: $8/hr = $16k/yr)   Jim Lux</pre>
